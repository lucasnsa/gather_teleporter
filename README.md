# Teleporter

A gather.town teleporter extension which gives the possibility to users to use special commands in the console.\
Some features may be deprecated with Gather town updates. c.f. https://gathertown.canny.io/changelog

## Installation

> **Warning**
> Note: With Chrome blocking the use of extensions using Manifest V2, the instructions below will not work. To still use the benefits of this extension use the instructions under the **Install Errors** section

Copy or clone the repo, then open chrome and go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) which will bring you to the extension manager page. Set your extensions as `Developer mode`, which can be enabled in the upper right corner. On the extension manager, go to the upper left corner to `Load Unpacked`, click on it, then select the repo on your local system.
Toggle the extension on and you are ready to go.

### Install Errors
If you encounter errors when installing, this may be due to Chromes migration away from Manifest V2. 
We currently have an issue open to migrate this extension to Manifest V3 (#24) but until then, please use the following workaround:

1. Copy the contents from [teleport.js](https://github.com/michmich112/teleporter/blob/master/teleport.js)
2. On your Gathertown tab, open the dev-tools (`F12`)
3. Go to the `console` tool, in your browser's dev-tools 
4. Paste the content you copied into the `console` tool and press `Enter`
5. You're good to go!
